## 7. Typography and Color Scheme

### Typography

- **Primary Font:** The game uses a sans-serif font like *Arial* or *Verdana* for readability and modern appearance.
- **Title Font:** A bold, playful font like *Comic Sans MS* or *Impact* is used for game titles and headings to attract attention and set a fun tone.

### Color Scheme

- **Background Colors:** Soft, pastel shades are used for backgrounds to avoid straining the eyes and to make the game visually appealing.
- **Card Colors:** Cards have distinct, vibrant colors to differentiate them easily. The card back design uses a subtle pattern.
- **Text Colors:** Dark colors (like navy blue or black) for text to ensure readability against lighter backgrounds.

## 8. Wireframes

Wireframes were designed to plan the layout of the game interface across different screen sizes.

- **Desktop View:** A grid layout with a score display at the top, the game grid in the center, and control buttons at the bottom.
- **Mobile View:** A vertically stacked layout where the score, timer, and controls are positioned at the top, followed by the game grid.
  
Wireframes were created using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. (Add screenshots or links to wireframes if available.)

## 9. Technology

### Tools and Libraries
